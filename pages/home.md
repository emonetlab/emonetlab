#### We use chemical navigation as a dynamic framework to explore how signals guide behaviors—ranging from molecules and cells to entire populations.

Our work unveils the intricate computations that empower organisms to sense and interpret their chemical world.

### What We Do

We blend mathematical modeling with quantitative experiments to decode the biological computations underlying how organisms navigate their environments. Our research dives deep into the principles of signal processing and decision making, revealing the marvelous mechanisms by which nature translates chemical signals into action.

### Why Chemical Navigation?

Chemical navigation is not just about following gradients—it involves a series of non-trivial computations that enable:

This innovative perspective offers a quantitative lens into the fundamental strategies organisms employs to cope with complex environments.

### From Bacteria to Fruit Flies

We investigate well-characterized systems such as bacterial chemotaxis and fly olfaction. By bridging microbiology and neuroscience, our dual-system approach:
