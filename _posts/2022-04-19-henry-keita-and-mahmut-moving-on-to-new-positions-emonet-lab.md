Great news! Three very talented postdocs, Henry Mattingly, Keita Kamino and Mahmut Demir, will be leaving the lab this summer to start new positions. Keita will be starting as an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Molecular Biology , Academia Sinica in Taiwan. Mahmut will start as Assistant Professor of Physics at Augusta University in Augusta GA. Meanwhile, Henry will be an Associate Research Scientist in the Center for Computational Biology at the Simons Foundation Flatiron Institute. Good luck to the three of them!
