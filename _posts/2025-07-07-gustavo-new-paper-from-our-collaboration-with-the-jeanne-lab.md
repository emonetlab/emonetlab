# Gustavo's new paper from our collaboration with the Jeanne Lab!

[Gustavo](https://emonet.biology.yale.edu/team/#Gustavo+Madeira+Santana) is a co-author on a new paper in Current Biology from our collaboration with the Jeanne Lab!

The team led by Hyong in James Jeanne's lab figured out how single neurons in the fruit fly brain can receive the same information and output different features of the signal, creating parallel pathways for computation and behavior in an olfactory circuit. This clever parallel system allows the fly to have both a steady, ongoing reaction to a smell and a separate, rapid surge in response to changes in that smell.

Congrats to Hyong, Gustavo, and Gizem!
