Check out our latest paper using optogenetics to examine how flies use both the frequency and duration of encouters with odor in their navigational strategy! In the wild, odor signals arrive unpredictably in discrete packets, driven by complex wind flows. How then can insects possibly locate odor sources? Here, we identify several features of odor plumes that flies use to robustly navigate odor environments with diverse temporal statistics.
