Congratulations to Nirag for being awarded an NIH postdoctoral training fellowship through the [BRAIN Initiative](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/)! Nirag proposed to develop machine-learning and computational tools for classification of behavior strategies, and to use these tools to understand how sensory adaptation aids olfactory navigation.
