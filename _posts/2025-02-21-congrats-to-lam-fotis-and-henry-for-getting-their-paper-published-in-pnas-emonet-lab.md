Lam, Fotis, and Henry demonstrated experimentally a novel mechanism of adaptation for migrating cell populations previously predicted by Henry ([PNAS 2022](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2117377119)) that enable them to quickly adapt their phenotypic composition to the demands of the environment they encounter, with out the need for environment dependent gene regulatin of mutations!
