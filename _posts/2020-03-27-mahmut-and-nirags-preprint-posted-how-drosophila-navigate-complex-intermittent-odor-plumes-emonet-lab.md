# Mahmut and Nirag’s preprint posted: How Drosophila navigate complex, intermittent odor plumes

Picture the smoke from a lit cigarette: in a few seconds, the plume disperses from a slowly meandering stream into a patchwork of disconnected filaments diffusing into the air. This type of odor signal — spatially complex, unpredictable, gradient-less – is typical of natural odor landscapes. In a new preprint, [posted on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.004218v1) , we explore how animals can navigate such plumes when other sensory inputs such as vision have been removed. Mahmut has developed an olfactory assay for *Drosophila* that allows us to visualize, in realtime, a  complex, fluctuating  odor signal simultaneously with fly behavior. Using dynamical models and inference, we quantify the strategies that flies use to successfully track these complex plumes to their source.
