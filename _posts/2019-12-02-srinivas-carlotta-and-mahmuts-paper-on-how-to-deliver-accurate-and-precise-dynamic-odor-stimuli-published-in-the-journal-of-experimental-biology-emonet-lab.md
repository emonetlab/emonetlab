# Srinivas’, Carlotta, and Mahmut’s paper on how to deliver accurate and precise dynamic odor stimuli published in the Journal of Experimental Biology!

In the real world, animals experience complex stimuli varying widely in composition, intensity, and temporal dynamics.  Stimuli commonly used in experimental studies, however, are far simpler, due to difficulties in precisely controlling odorants. In our new study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, we illustrate using simple mathematical models of odorant kinetics and experimental protocols how to accurately and reproducibly deliver a wide range of stimuli.
