Jeremy is now Dr. Moore! Jeremy gave a beautiful presentaion for his thesis defense. During his PhD, he made incredible contributions to our understanding of chemotaxis. Jeremy is also a key member of the community and will be greatly missed by everyone.

Congratulations, Jeremy! We are so proud of you and excited to see what you do next!
