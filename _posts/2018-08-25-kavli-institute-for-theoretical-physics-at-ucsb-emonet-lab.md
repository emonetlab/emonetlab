Thierry and Nirag spent the month of August at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in UC Santa Barbara as part of the “Neural computations for sensory navigation” program. Check out all  [talks](http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/snav18/)  from physicists, biologists, mathematicians, neuroscientists, and ecologists all trying to understand the neural mechanisms underlying effective sensory navigation.
