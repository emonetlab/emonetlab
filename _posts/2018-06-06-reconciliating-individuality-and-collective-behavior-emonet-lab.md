# Reconciliating individuality and collective behavior

![High- (red) and low-performance (blue) bacteria migrate together]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2018-06-06-reconciliating-individuality-and-collective-behavior-emonet-lab/screen_shot_2018-06-06_at_11.22.15_am.png)

Diversity and collective behavior are both beneficial to groups. However, collective behavior requires coordination whereas diversity tends to reduce it. Our paper on how bacteria resolve this conflict in order to migrate together just came out: [Fu et al. Nature Communications 9, Article number: 2177 (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04539-4). This research was funded by the Allen Distinguished Investigator Program through The Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group and by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.
