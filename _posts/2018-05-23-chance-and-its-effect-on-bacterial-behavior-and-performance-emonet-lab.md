# Chance and its effect on bacterial behavior and performance

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2018-05-23-chance-and-its-effect-on-bacterial-behavior-and-performance-emonet-lab/screen_shot_2018-05-25_at_11.34.59_am.png)

Our review on how chance generates diversity and affect behavior and performance in population of isogenic cells is out. After briefly summarizing the architecture and logic of the bacterial chemotaxis system of *E. coli*, we discuss determinants of behavior and chemotactic performance of individual cells. Then, we review how cell-to-cell differences in protein abundance map onto differences in individual chemotactic abilities and how phenotypic variability affects the performance of the population. We conclude with open questions.
