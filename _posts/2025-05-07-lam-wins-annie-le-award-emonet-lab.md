This week Lam won the Annie Le award, which recognizes outstanding doctoral students in the Biological and Biomedical sciences for their academic achievements, and service to the New Haven community. Lam was the director of Open Labs, an science outreach organization that serves middle schoolers in the broader New Haven area. He was also secretary for both the Yale chapter of SACNAS, and the Wu Tsai Institute student & postdoc committee. Scientifically, Lam is interested in how groups of diverse bacteria solve navigation problems collectively.
