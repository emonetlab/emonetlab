# Discovery of odor motion detection published in Nature

Congratulation Nirag, Mahmut and Brian for the publication in [Nature](https://rdcu.be/cZkdV) of their discovery that flies can smell the motion of odor packets transported by the wind and use that information to enhance their navigation towards odor sources. This work beautifully combines our lab’s expertise in olfactory navigation with that of Damon Clark’s in visual motion detection and was made possible by the collaborative space provided by the [QBio Institute](http://qbio.yale.edu) where our labs resides. That there is a motion detector in the fly olfactory system opens a bunch of exciting questions for future research.
